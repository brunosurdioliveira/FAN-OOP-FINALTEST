# FAN-OOP-FINALTEST
final test of JavaScript2
Begin by renaming the Final_Test.html page to <your first name>_Final_Test.html. For example: Jim_Final_Test.html.
This exercise requires you to make multiple changes to the original Final_Test.html page, based on the following list of requirements.
1. Finish the PicType class by adding in a constructor that takes three parameters (name, width and height) and creates three corresponding properties named _name, _width and _height. Also create a “getter” and a “setter” for each of the properties.
2. Find the “onload” event handler named “startMeUp” and then code up a “for.. loop” that will traverse the global array called “pics”. On each iteration of the loop, create a new PicType object using the current “pics” element value as the “name” property and default values of 256 and 192 for the “width” and “height” properties respectively. Finally, take the new object and “push” it into the global “objArray” array.
3. Find the “showHTML5Pic” function and add the single line of code required to draw the “canvas” version of the image using the “pic” version. Also, write the three lines of code necessary to fill the text boxes with the corresponding current object property values.
4. Find the last two functions, “previousPic” and “nextPic” and add the code required to:
a. Update the “canvas" image.
b. Load the three text boxes with property values from the current objArray
object.
5. Test and debug your finished page so that it works in the same way as the version demonstrated as part of the included video.
When your work is completed, submit your HTML page as a single zip file to the submission folder “Final Test”.
